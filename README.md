# Battery Monitor

A lightweight tool that monitors your laptop's battery and provides intelligent charging recommendations to maximize battery lifespan.

## Motivation

After burning through several laptop batteries, my motivation to build this tool is to protect my laptop's lithium battery from the two main causes of degradation:

- **Overcharging**: Staying plugged in at 100% for extended periods
- **Deep discharge**: Allowing the battery to remain at critically low levels

Therefore, the tool helps tracks battery health metrics and provides timely notifications about when to plug or unplug my charger, helping me maintain optimal battery health over time.

## Features

- ðŸ”‹ Real-time battery monitoring
- ðŸ“Š Battery health data tracking
- ðŸ”” Smart charging/unplugging notifications
- ðŸ“ˆ Historical battery performance analytics
- âš¡ Lightweight and efficient operation

## How It Works

The tool continuously monitors your battery level and provides recommendations based on configurable thresholds:
- **Unplug reminder**: When battery reaches your defined upper threshold (e.g., 80-90%)
- **Plug reminder**: When battery drops to your defined lower threshold (e.g., 20-30%)
